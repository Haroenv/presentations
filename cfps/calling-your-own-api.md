### description

There are two main types of APIs that are called on a regular basis, the first is when you call a third-party API via their API client, you have to trust that they do everything right. The second is when you call your own API, where you should learn all nuances yourself. 

At Algolia, we develop various API clients for different use cases, and recently rebuilt a version of our main API client from scratch and would love to share with you what the key learnings are we had regarding calling an API and all its surrounding architecture.

### notes

All the learnings we made during making v4 and earlier versions of our JavaScript API client are shared here. Also some references to things in other API clients and things we chose not to do.
