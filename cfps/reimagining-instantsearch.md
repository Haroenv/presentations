title: Reimagining InstantSearch as a framework-agnostic library
type: cfp
---

### description

Let's say you picked a framework to use. You use some libraries that work well with that framework, maybe you make your own. A few years later you don't like it anymore and need to find replacements to work with your new framework. 

As a library maintainer, a great bunch of your users will be switching frameworks over time. You'll want to make both your life in maintaining multiple versions simple as well as avoiding users to jump through many hoops implementing your library.

### summary

Tips on how we switched from an architecture where we had a complete new InstantSearch flavour per framework, to one where we can build onto the primitives of InstantSearch into other frameworks.

### notes

This talk will focus on the concept called Connectors used in making InstantSearch for Angular, based on the version for plain JS (using preact behind the scenes)

### Bio

Maintaining open source libraries for Algolia like InstantSearch (js, React, Vue) and lower-level libraries used by those. Belgian living in Paris.
