### description

You might have noticed before, but since the end of last year, its been possible to look up packages on the Yarn website. It’s a community project done by Algolia, by replicating the npm registry, together with other sources. A front-end search has been made with React, as well as a detail page, which fetches data from sources with other types of rate limit.

### summary

Find out how the Yarn search became a possibility, from replicating npm in Algolia, to fetching extra data from GitHub and working OSS.

### notes

Depending on some other factors, the public announcement of the free to use Yarn search API might happen here or at another event, but it's going to be part of the focus.

I was an intern from February to May at Algolia, responsible for search on the Yarn website, the npm ↔️ Algolia replicator and the detail pages of the packages, like [yarn.pm/react](https://yarn.pm/react)

### Bio

Maintaining front-end libraries at Algolia like React InstantSearch after doing an internship focused around research and the Yarn search experience
