1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:07,350
So let's talk about Bullgit by
an example, let's talk about my

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,900
clock, our clock, that is so fast.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,310
It was banned from GitHub.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,970
So I'm Haroen and I will
be representing Bullgit.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,300
A bit about me.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,720
I work at Algolia, but that
doesn't really matter right now.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,230
But if you want to ask about
it, it's perfectly normal.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,060
Bullgit is important.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,010
But

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,810
What's really, what I do when
I want to look at the time.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,720
First, I tried to look
at this emoji, right?

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,520
The clock, but it's wrong.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,140
It's not 10 past 10.

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,460
So then I had to find a solution and
the solution is basically like this.

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,470
So I go to a browser and enter
bullg.it/fast-clock, and then it loads.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,790
And so this is a time as you can
see, it's completely correct,

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,730
except the year and everything else.

18
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:00,285
And so why is that?

19
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:03,135
Let's take a look at this
link at the bottom there.

20
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:06,315
View the code on book on GitHub, right?

21
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:08,175
Yeah.

22
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:08,835
Yeah.

23
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:17,414
So, something happened let's look. Luckily
I still had the code on my computer, so I

24
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:20,175
push it to GitHub and I cloned it again.

25
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:21,675
That's fast clock archive.

26
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,125
This one still exists, but.

27
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,780
This number is pretty big.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
It's 157 megabytes for
the site you saw earlier.

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,660
How is that?

30
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,670
Like, these are the files.

31
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,620
They don't look very special.

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,810
It's just a Jekyll page.

33
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,710
Let's just take a look at the index HTML.

34
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,090
Is something there very big?

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,360
No, no, it's not very big.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,950
We're just going to, so if
you're unfamiliar with the Jekyll

37
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,665
Syntax, Do I have a pointer here?

38
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:57,965
Yeah.

39
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:03,875
So here are going to take a look
at the data and the configuration

40
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,795
variable called site.time.

41
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:12,984
We're going to have it as an XML
schema, and also a regular RFC-822

42
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:15,125
date, the normal one, the one you saw.

43
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:23,105
So let's take a look at config.yml
to see what this time thing really is.

44
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:25,275
It's a string.

45
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:31,935
So this is the date string, and it's
going to be pushed to the site, perfectly

46
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:39,345
normal, static, whatever, or mostly, I think?
Static, a clock, something's wrong there.

47
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:44,595
Let's take a look again at this
archive now that it's public.

48
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:45,765
[Oh, that's too much]

49
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:47,085
Yeah.

50
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:49,065
Uh, at this archive.

51
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,915
So we're seeing something here.

52
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,600
That's a bunch of commits.

53
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,400
So why are there so many commits?

54
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,440
I don't really know.

55
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:07,830
So normally when you make a commit, right,
we're using GitHub pages, so then gets

56
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:14,190
her, we'll take this, this Jekyll site and
make it into a website available at bullg.it/fast-clock

57
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,080
as normal.

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,470
Right.

59
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,370
But you can also have
something in between.

60
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:23,475
Uh, CI as we call it
continuous integration.

61
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:27,674
And this one will look like this.

62
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,195
This is our,
configuration file for Travis.

63
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:34,174
So just, just regular shell and we
have a secure environment variable.

64
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:35,234
We'll see.

65
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:38,745
So let's take a look at the rest, right?

66
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:41,204
The script.

67
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:47,924
So we're starting with some sed, I
don't know if, um, Some of you might

68
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:49,095
be old enough to know about it.

69
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:49,725
I was not.

70
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,714
Uh, but I, I, I, uh, figured it out.

71
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:54,975
This is the best way to do it.

72
00:03:55,334 --> 00:04:00,315
So we're going to edit, this is direct
editor on the comment line, and we're

73
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:05,565
going to replace with a regex or find
the line that has commits, colon, and

74
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:08,864
then we're going to put the commits
and then the build number of Travis.

75
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:09,494
Right?

76
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:10,424
Okay.

77
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,010
Hey, there's a, there's one done,
but exactly the same for time also

78
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,670
happens with a, with their command
on unix that's called time.

79
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,100
And then it's going to put this, this
time variable right now on Travis,

80
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,940
into the config.yml that we're using.

81
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,770
Somehow we're not using it for
anything yet. after success.

82
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:40,395
Oh, yeah, these two should
have been, uh, switched.

83
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:40,845
Sorry.

84
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:44,865
Uh, so this year we're going to
take the time, get the data and just

85
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:51,225
format it as we, as a Jekyll expect
and put it also in config.yaml is

86
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:58,845
this an in place replace and then
git config global push.

87
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:02,865
We're going to have a username, right.

88
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:04,245
And an email.

89
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:10,695
It's a Felix email, um, because he was,
volunteering to get all the emails.

90
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:18,245
So, and then the next thing we're
going to commit, and we're going

91
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:22,385
to commit with a nice, friendly
commit message to tell the time.

92
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:26,885
And then now we're getting interesting.

93
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:30,635
We're pushing to the
GitHub repository again.

94
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,810
So, what did we have earlier?

95
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,290
Right?

96
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,640
You make a commit and
the site gets built.

97
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,820
We made the commit and Travis runs, right?

98
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,880
It's like this now.

99
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,640
So what happens once this
commit has been made by Travis?

100
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,270
Not by me.

101
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,140
It runs again on Travis because
every commit triggers the.

102
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,890
Triggers the CI and then a new
version of the site can be built.

103
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,210
And this way is basically the most
efficient way you can make a clock ever.

104
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,039
And that's why we call it fast clock.

105
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,640
So bullgit, what does bullgit really mean?

106
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,300
It really mean bullshit on GitHub.

107
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,190
That's what bullgit is.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,090
Okay.

109
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,780
So bullgit is a community of
devs and non-devs as well.

110
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,730
Uh, and we're all over the world.

111
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,840
Uh, we're mostly in Europe because yeah,
that's how the internet kind of works.

112
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,780
So if you know people in, in, in other
parts of the world, please tell them

113
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,960
to come to bullgit because we want to
have everyone from the whole world.

114
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,190
Uh, you can find this map
also on our, on our website.

115
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,940
And recently we existed since, four years.

116
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:58,395
So in, uh, June and our founder
actually is in the room, uh, there.

117
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:01,455
And, um, so that's it.

118
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:04,515
So how do we, how did we start?

119
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:11,325
So there was a contest on
Codepen and Tim and a few others.

120
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:17,715
They made this, uh, this nice talk.io
logo because talk.io was a new.

121
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:25,695
chat platform and it was about
the codepen channel on talk.io.

122
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:32,835
And so it started with chatted
on, on talk.io then later we

123
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:39,015
also had some on Google Hangouts
because talk.io kind of stopped,

124
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,755
but now we're mostly on Gitter.

125
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:43,815
So this is basically
what the site looks like.

126
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:47,715
Nowadays is a bit an older
screenshot, but we share things.

127
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:51,315
Or we give them feedback
and things like that.

128
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:54,945
So you should join a
developer group for fun.

129
00:07:56,284 --> 00:08:01,474
You should join a developer developer group
for finding solutions to your problems,

130
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:03,935
to talk about whatever you want.

131
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:05,674
It doesn't need to be about developing.

132
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:11,104
It can be about you're feeling bad
today, and it helps to have people to

133
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:14,734
talk to. You also learn lots of things.

134
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:18,715
The, the clock example earlier
was the first time I did CI.

135
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:22,335
And it was fun. To share what you made.

136
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,474
If you make something cool, you make
it at work and make it that fun that we

137
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:29,955
can just have this, this, this circle
of people that know each other and

138
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:34,605
interest in each other, and that can
make your influence circle even bigger.

139
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:41,054
And we also can meet up at
conferences, but this advice does

140
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,725
not only go for developer groups.

141
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:49,515
Those are just goes for making bullshit,
make whatever you want, have fun doing it.

142
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:50,714
And you learn loads.

143
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:57,045
Last year, we met up at a view source
in Berlin, and now we are with,

144
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:59,925
with quite a few of us here.

145
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:08,324
So feel free to join us, follow us on
Twitter, uh, and watch out our website.

146
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,185
Thank you for your attention.
